# Texas-Holdem-Evaluator

Make a program that can create, 
evaluate and compare 5-card poker hands.

We have **cards**, **decks**, and **hands**.

- Card will be a class that contains rank and suit variables,

- Deck will be a container for Cards, and 

- Hand will be where we evaluate and compare the poker hands.
